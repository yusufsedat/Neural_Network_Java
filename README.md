## The goal of this project is to train and evaluate a neural network model using Momentum Backpropagation and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) architectures. The project compares different network configurations to identify the most efficient model.
### Key Features
##### Model Architectures:

- Various MLP configurations such as (2, 5, 1), (2, 10, 5, 1), (2, 15, 10, 1), etc.

- Momentum-based learning to accelerate convergence.

##### Training Techniques:

- Backpropagation with and without momentum.

- Cross-validation using K-Fold.

##### Performance Metrics:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE) for both training and testing phases.

- Real-time prediction using user inputs.
